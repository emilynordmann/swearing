## Relationship between age and vocabulary


```{r, echo = FALSE}
corr_dat <- as.data.frame(all_counts %>%
  spread(key = type, value = score) %>%
    select(age, animal, swear))

vocab_corr <- correlate(corr_dat, test = TRUE, p.adjust.method = "holm")
vocab_corr
```

The correlation between age and animals is r = `r vocab_corr$correlation[1,2] %>% round(2)`, p = `r vocab_corr$p.value[1,2] %>% round(3)`. 

The correlation between age and swears is r = `r vocab_corr$correlation[1,3] %>% round(2)`, p = `r vocab_corr$p.value[1,3] %>% round(3)`. 

The correlation between swears and animals is r = `r vocab_corr$correlation[3,2] %>% round(2)`, p = `r vocab_corr$p.value[3,2] %>% round(3)`. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
corr_dat %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = .panel_x, y = .panel_y)) +
  geom_autodensity() +
  facet_matrix(vars(age, animal, swear), layer.diag = 2) +
  theme_bw()
```


## Vocabulary scores by gender

### General fluency

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
all_counts %>%
  filter(type == "animal") %>%
  drop_na(gender) %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(average_score = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  knitr::kable(align = 'c', digits = 2)  

```

<br>

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
all_counts %>%
  filter(type == "animal") %>%
  drop_na(gender) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = score, fill = gender)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, alpha = .5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE, alpha = .7, width = .2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "E")
```

### Swearing

```{r, echo=FALSE}
all_counts %>%
  filter(type == "swear") %>%
  drop_na(gender) %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(average_score = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  knitr::kable(align = 'c', digits = 2)  

```

<br>

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
all_counts %>%
  filter(type == "swear") %>%
  drop_na(gender) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = score, fill = gender)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, alpha = .5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE, alpha = .7, width = .2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "E")
```

## Most frequent swear words

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
dat_swears%>%
  na.omit()%>%
  count(words, sort = TRUE)%>%
  head(10) %>%
  mutate(percent = n/sum(n)*100) %>%
  mutate(words = reorder(words, percent))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = words, y = percent, fill = words))+
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE)+
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "D")
```

## Word cloud

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning  = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
swears <- all_dat %>%
  filter(type == "swear")

wordcloud(words = swears$words, max.words = 90, min.freq = 1)
```

## Most frequent words by gender

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning  = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
dat_swears%>%
  na.omit()%>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  count(words, sort = TRUE)%>%
  top_n(10) %>% 
  mutate(percent = n/sum(n)*100) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(words = reorder_within(words, percent, gender)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = words, y = percent, fill = words))+
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE)+
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "E") +
  facet_wrap(~gender, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_x_reordered()
```

## Word cloud - men
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
swears_man <- swears %>%
  filter(gender == "Man")

swears_woman <- swears %>%
  filter(gender == "Woman")

swears_other <- swears %>%
  filter(gender == "Other")
  
wordcloud(words = swears_man$words, max.words = 90, min.freq = 1)

```

## Word cloud - women

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
wordcloud(words = swears_woman$words, max.words = 90, min.freq = 1)
```

## Word cloud - non-binary/other

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
wordcloud(words = swears_other$words, max.words = 90, min.freq = 1)
```
